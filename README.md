The basics of the story is that there is a dragon who has had his lamp stolen, but he can't fit into the caves to get it himself so he sends you. The lamp was stolen by dwarves and they will attack you on sight!

Every time you complete a level you go to a reward level where you can get new items.

The controls:

Arrow keys move you around. You can't move diagonally, but dwarves can, so watch out!

To pick up items it takes two key strokes. You press 'g' and then a direction with the arrow keys. So if the item is right below you, you press 'g' and then down arrow etc.

There are three useable items: the cloak of invisibility, the smoke bomb, and the wand of fire. When you pick up a useable item it gets assigned to the skill bar which you will see on top of the dungeon. Each slot in the skill bar is assigned to keys 1-5. For instance if you pick up the cloak of invisibility as your first item, you can use it by pressing the '1' key and you will be made invisible for a few turns.

You use the smoke bomb by pressing 't' and then a direction to throw the bomb in with the arrow keys.

You use the wand of fire by pressing 's' and then a direction to shoot in with the arrow keys.

Let me know what you think! It's pretty basic, but it has been fun to make.

Dragon's Descent is a roguelike inspired by games such as Nethack, Caves of Qud, Tales of Maj'Eyal. 
My goals were to experiment with the Godot Engine and to create a roguelike with improved moment to moment
strategic gameplay. The game is currently a rough prototype.
